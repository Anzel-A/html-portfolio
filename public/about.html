<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is An≈æe and I am currently studying Computer Science. All my grades are A+, which is 10 in my country of Slovenia. I like programing. In the past, I learned and worked with HTML, CSS, JS, C#, Python and Java. I used frameworks like .net core MVC, Flask, Django and others. Node.js which is a JavaScript runtime environment for backend is also known to me. I want to learn PHP and it's popular MVC framework Laravel and also in combination with Vue.js. If I learn the two, there is a much bigger possibility, that I can land a job at a local company.</p>

<p>I really like animals. I had 6 turtles, now I have 2 cats, which I love deeply. I treat them as if they were my children. They are extremely cute but sometimes hard to maintain. Nevertheless, the bottom line is, that they are my life and I would do anything for them.</p>

<p>Programing is my hobby and possible future job. Other hobbies also include everything with computers and computer games. I like playing ark. Taming dinosaurs is great, but building castles and villages is even better.</p>
